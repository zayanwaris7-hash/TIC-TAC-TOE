# TIC-TAC-TOE
Simple but Loogical
This simple Tic Tac Toe project is a web-based game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where two players can play against each other by taking turns marking “X” and “O” in a 3×3 grid. The main purpose of the project was to strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic implementation in JavaScript, as well as designing a clean and responsive user interface with CSS. During development, I faced several challenges: one of the main difficulties was implementing the winner-checking logic correctly, ensuring that the game would stop after a player wins and display the winner’s message. Another challenge was handling the reset functionality, where I had to make sure the board clears completely, buttons become clickable again, and the winner message disappears. Additionally, designing the CSS to make the game visually appealing, responsive, and intuitive required careful planning, especially with hover effects, button styling, and centering the grid. Overall, this project helped me improve my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and ability to debug issues in JavaScript and CSS while creating a functional and interactive application.
